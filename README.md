## Overview
The class project was to design a racing robot which can follow a curving and self-crossing racetrack at speeds greater than 3 meters per second using an optical sensor. Each team starts with a standard 1/10th-scale RC car platform and a pre-built CPU board, determines an optimal strategy, and designs sensors, electronics, and control algorithms. Vehicles individually follow a 100 meter course, staying on track and avoiding obstacles.
